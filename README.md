# About the Theme of the project.
Baseball Trivia is actually a bit of a misnomer, as the Game is really about the user providing some of the answers to a famous Abbot and Costello comedy bit themed around wordplay and Baseball.  The player who guesses all the answers is rewarded with a viewing of the famous comedy sketch.
